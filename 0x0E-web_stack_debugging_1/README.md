# Web stack debugging #1

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studiese* at **ALX Africa**. It aims to learn about how to debug a web stack to a working state.

# Tasks

This was the second in a series of web stack debugging projects. In these projects, I was given broken/bugged webstacks in isolated containers, and tasked with fixing the web stack to a working state. For each task, I wrote a script automating the commands necessary to fix the web stack.


## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 5.0.17(1)
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

# Files

The following files are bash scripts.

| Filename | Description |
